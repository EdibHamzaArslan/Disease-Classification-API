# Disease-Classification-API

## Project Setup
First of all you need to download pre-request libraries. (I assume that you have working with anaconda)
* pip install -r requirements.txt

For linux and mac os, to run flask api you should define path

- export FLASK_APP=app 
- export FLASK_ENV=development 
- flask run
